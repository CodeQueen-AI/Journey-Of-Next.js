# Rendering
Rendering is the process of converting code into a visual user interface

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) 
the server generates the HTML on the server before sending it to the browser

# Client-Side Rendering (CSR) 
the browser loads a blank page and populates content using JavaScript

# Static Site Generation (SSG) 
HTML is pre-generated at build time and served as static files

# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) 
ISR allows static pages to be updated at runtime while still benefiting from SSG
