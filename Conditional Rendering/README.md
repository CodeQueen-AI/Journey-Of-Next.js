# Conditional Rendering
it is the process of displaying different content and components in a Next.js based on specific condition

1-You can show different UI elements depending on conditions like user login status etc

2-Conditional rendering uses JavaScript logic (like if, ternary operator and && operator) to decide what to render

3-It allows Next.js components to change their rendered output based conditions
